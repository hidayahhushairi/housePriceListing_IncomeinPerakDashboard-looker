## Introduction : 
- Property affordability receives impact by the incoming rise in the cost of living. This research was carried out to identify the possible application of affordability measures of first owned-property by the middle income group in Malaysia. Essentially, other expenses on food, entertainment, transportation, maintenance fees, would be hard-pressed to locate any savings left over at the end of the month. However, under any circumstances, the need for property especially housing as a basic necessity persists. On the other hand, property prices are affected significantly by many factors, including the income, property market, land cost and insufficient supply. This creates a dilemma among developers that not be able to sell property at an affordable price, as the property market holds property well purchased at high prices. As decision purchasing property can cost a lot of money, this research is hoped to contribute to local to weigh many aspects including property location, locality development planning and geo-risk areas, and understanding affordability in adhering an income budget to the preferred property.

    - Depicted in the diagram, Kinta district record the highest property purchase, with overall sum 17.4k, compared to the least purchase in Bagan Datuk, 271. Kinta collectively have a larger population than other districts, owing to urbanisation and large population demand. Three leading preferred landed properties in Kinta are 2-1/2 storey terraced (5501), followed by 1-1/2 storey terraced (5313), and low-cost house (1663). This research rise knowledge to the public about the current property demand in certain areas. We can also check the adequacy of the potential property purchase specifically.

    - RTD or Rancangan Tempatan Daerah, is the government strategy of (ACT 172). It is the detailed digital document of all policies and general recommendations for the development and use of land. Every planning can have an impact on the local population whether in terms of property value, road traffic and anything related to new developments or changes to be made. Revealing RTD on this model from direct source by PLANMalaysia website, can increase the general knowledge to observe and allow public disprove opposing irrelevant development planning. On the other hand, this model also shows the geo-risk disaster areas to ensure local considerate of the potential house area that will be affected due to seasonal geo-risk disasters and prevent the massive damage of property.

- In Malaysia, the most widely adopted model is the median multiple, whereby the median of property price serve as multiple of median annual income. Based on the graph, it appears that Perak Tengah district reach the highest median of property price, with total median RM 7,639 000. Perak Tengah covers the city of Seri Iskandar and towns such as Pekan Bota Kanan, Pekan Parit, Pekan Kampong Buloh Akar, Pekan Kota Setia and Pekan Tanjong Belanja.

- The properties in Perak generally are priced at RM 370000 and below. RM600000 are particularly high-rise buildings. The pattern in darkest yellow cell across property type shows that median of property price values more conventional in 2-2 1/2 Storey Semi-Detached house (RM 600000), whereas least conventional in the property Low-Cost Flat (RM 70000).

- Projected in this graph, NAPIC recorded the property transaction has grew strikingly during 2022.  During the same time period, house prices decreased by 0.27% when adjusted for inflation. It was the pent-up demand following the economy recovery from the fiscal impact COVID-19 crisis.

This indicates unsold or overhang properties have reduced slightly in the second quarter. During the third and forth quarter in 2024, property transaction reduced to 2771 and 957 purchases. Local can opting to invest their budget into the property transaction at the most stable market price. It is also initial to consider property with bargain prices, as there are good product unsold still because of price mismatched beyond the means of mass market.

- This research applied median over average wages, due to the average wages skewed by extremely high income earners. As per DOSM latest available data shown, the middle income group in Malaysia consecutively obtain approximately 15.43% of growth in median monthly income, from 2020 until 2023.

- This model calculated monthly installment and property price based on wages and interest rate. Lower interest rate with a longer loan tenure lead to accessible property price, but can rise higher price depending on the increased demand that causing inflation, especially in areas with limited housing supply. In 2025, Malaysia's property loan interest rates are competitive, and major banks provide flexible loan options to meet the demands of various homeowners. Local can obtain the best rate by comparing interest rate from several banks while considering fees, lock-in periods and flexibility features. However for this model, we used common and fixed interest rate following the maukerja sources. For example, if prospective local Nina was concern to buy a property in Perak, with monthly salary RM 2500, she can choose 30% interest rate for 30 years of loan tenure. With this computation, she will get monthly installment about RM 750 and a RM 187500 property, which are equivalent to low-cost house or flat. Local have to measure eligibility for allocating property budget so that they can acquire relevant total house price that align with affordability and wages.

## Conclusion :
- Finding reveal that house affordability is a grave concern to average Malaysian especially among the middle income group. It is identified that the property in Perak are priced between RM 600000, RM 370000 and below. Median property price can be far above the affordable property price, especially for local with monthly salary below RM 5000 . At the same time, median monthly income in Perak based on the current data 2023, is RM 2045 and expected to continue rising in upcoming years, determined by the economic growth, policy decisions and other factors. Meanwhile, location offers solid factor that associate with property transaction decision made by local. Government, property developers and banks, need to forged an alliance to solve the disparity between income and property prices issue. Government needs to create high-value economic activities and employment for Malaysian with relevant income, so that local can afford a property. Property developers should conduct studies on development to be constructed, while authorities should ensure that approvals are given only to projects that match the actual requirements and affordability.
